# Imagine you are creating a game that features multiple characters
# You can use a dictionary to store multiple, distinct pieces of data
# this is what is meant by key-value pairs, as shown below 

# As you can see in the terminal: 
# the dictionary stores each key-value as seperate data points
# the first bit is the "key, and the seconf is the "value"

mobster_0 = {"build": "athletic", "points": "7"}
