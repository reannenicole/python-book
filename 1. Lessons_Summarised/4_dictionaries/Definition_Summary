A dictionary is a collection of "key-value pairs" Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key.

A key’s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary.

In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.

In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces, {}, with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces.

Using dictionaries allows you to model things more accurately. for example: 

You’ll be able to create a dictionary representing a
person and then store as much information as you want about that person.
You can store their name, age, location, profession, and any other aspect of

a person you can describe. You’ll be able to store any two kinds of informa-
tion that can be matched up, such as a list of words and their meanings, a

list of people’s names and their favorite numbers, a list of mountains and
their elevations, and so forth.
