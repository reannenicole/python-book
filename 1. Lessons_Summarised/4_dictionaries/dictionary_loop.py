# Lets say you wanted a dictionary that stored all user information, this would looks something like the following: 

user_1 = {
"first_name": "james",
"second_name": "joyce",
"username": "jjoyce1",}

print(user_1)

# Instead of printing like the above, you can pull out the individual key value pairs with a for loop 

for key, value in user_1.items():
 print("\nKey: " + key)
 print("Value: " + value)

# You can use this function to prestn data in numerous ways
